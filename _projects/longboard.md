I spent much of my senior year in high school designing, building, and riding a custom motorized longboard with a 6 miles range and 22mph top speed.

### Features
- single reduction drivetrain powered by two 270Kv brushless outrunners
- custom 2-layer main control PCB
- 5Ah 6S LiCoO2 battery
- CNC-milled motor mounts with a waterjetted electronics mounting plate that doubles as a heatsink
- 3D printed electronics enclosure
- eight individuall addressable status LEDs
- on-board 90W CC/CV charging circuit powered by my laptop's AC adapter

### Remote
I developed a fully-custom wireless remote to control my longboard, with a 900mAh lithium battery that provides over 36 hours of continuous use from a two hour charge over USB.

The electronics of the remote were built around an ATmega32u4 microcontroller and nRF24L01+ 2.4Ghz transciever IC.
