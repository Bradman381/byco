I built a quadrotor over my high school's 2012 winter break.

With a 450mm nylon frame, the quad is powered by four 930Kv brushless outrunners, two pairs of 10x4.5in counter-rotating propellors, and 30A speed controllers.

In terms of electronics, I used an Arduino equipped with an MPU-6050 IMU for orientation feedback, as an off-the-shelf 2.4Ghz RC radio handles communication for teleoperated control.
