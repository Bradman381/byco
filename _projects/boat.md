### Overview

At the end of my senior year in high school, a friend and I decided to participate in the [Moat Boat Paddle Battle](http://www.moatboatpaddlebattle.com/) at the Bay Area Maker Faire.

We had to design and 3D print a paddle boat powered by two rubber bands that could travel 12 feet. Because of the energy limitation, we focused on the efficiency of the boat. We prototyped many hull and paddle designs to reduce drag and maximize the propelling force.

Our final design featured:
- a helical winch drive system for a constant torque output
- 3D printed bearing "bumpers" that reduced energy losses from collisions
- an extremely low drag catamaran-style dual-hull design with a rear spoiler

We won our division at the contest, the prize for which was an Orion Delta 3D printer.
