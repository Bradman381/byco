### Overview

Job Shadow is a PTSA-run program at my high school that aims to give students a glimpse into future career options by allowing them to shadow members of industry for a day.

As a volunteer, I worked on the development and maintenence of a Django-powered student management site that streamlines student registration and job matching. Each of the 400+ students who participate in the program each year use the system, which has saved hundreds of hours of manual labor by replacing a previously paper-based setup.

For my contributions to the program, I was recognized with the "Very Special Person Award" at our PTSA's 2014 Honorary Service Awards ceremony.
