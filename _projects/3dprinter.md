### Overview

Junior year of high school: I really wanted a 3D printer, but they were still really expensive at the time. Then, I discovered the good work being done by the folks working on the [RepRap project](http://reprap.org/).

By leveraging open source designs (specifically the [Prusa i3](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3) and [Wilson](http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Wilson)), an Arduino microcontroller, a used XBox 360 power supply, and a couple hundred hours of my own design changes, I built this open-frame printer for ~$230.

Features:
- single 3mm filament extruder with a 0.5mm nozzle
- 8" x 8" x 7" build volume
- successfully tested up to a 100mm/sec max print speed
